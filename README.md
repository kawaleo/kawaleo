I'm a 13 year old, indie, full stack developer and content creator trying my best to contribute to the open-source community as much as possible. All of my projects are built from scratch, designing, building, and solving problems with code. I have a pretty small YouTube channel, so if you want to support me, you should visit that!

### ðŸš€ My programming journey

My first experience with programming was when I was 7 years old, using Lua to create games on Roblox. However, I moved on from Lua and only recently rediscovered it, using it for more real-world applications.

My second programming language was Java, which I learned because of my interest in Minecraft mods and hacked clients. I even created my own hacked client using Java, which taught me a lot.

HTML was my third "language" as I learned it to make websites. After a month of learning HTML, I began learning CSS and now I'm fluent in both after approximately one month. As I ventured into web development, I began learning Javascript, spending two months on it. I then learned NodeJS and some of its features, which took about four months.

After HTML I learned Python which only took a few days, there's not much to say there. I don't really like it.

My latest discovery was Rust, which I learned about from YouTube and decided to give it a try. I've been using Rust ever since and have put it into practice by making my own programming language, CLI tools, and even creating crates on crates.io. Although I haven't yet completed the Rust book, I find it awesome and enjoy using it.

For text editing, I used to use VSCode but eventually moved on to Neovim for its customizability and efficiency. Although it had a high learning curve and took a while to customize, I eventually got it working to my liking.
